# Code Documentation and project structure

- Project Management Tasks  
	- [x] There should be a logical directory structure (i.e ./source ./bin ./docs) folders.
		- Major directories are /source - for all code dealing  with the client and testing, /res for the server and all of its parts, and /docs 		   for all of the documentation. 
	- [x] Your code should be fully documented using ddoc style documentation. 	
  	- [x] Run ddoc and push your documentation to your repository in a folder called 'docs'
	- [x] You should have a .gitignore file to ignore binaries.
		- .gitignore is in the top level directory
